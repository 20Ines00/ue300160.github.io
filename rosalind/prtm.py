# a script that will take an aminoacid sequence as input and print out
# the molecular weight of the peptide

# Instructions:
# 1. read the data
# 2. define the dictionary (key: amino acid one letter code, value: mass in Da)
# 3. (actual solution):
#   - define a counter variable, total_weight, and set it to 0
#   - loop over the input,
#   - for the current amino acid, take the value from the dictionary, and add it to total_weight
#   
#   print total_weight
